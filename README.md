# JavaGame
 Turn‑Based Battle Game (Java) – Text‑based RPG prototype where players enter a hero name and fight a monster in turn‑based combat. The game displays current stats and available actions each turn, updates them after every input, and ends automatically when either combatant’s HP reaches zero. Built with object‑oriented design, input validation, and simple RNG‑based damage mechanics.
